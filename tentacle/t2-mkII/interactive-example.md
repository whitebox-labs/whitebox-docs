# Interactive, Bidirectional Communications

For this project you'll need:
* Arduino
* 1 or 2 Tentacle Mini
* 1-4 Atlas Scientific circuits
* Computer with Arduino IDE installed

This example demonstrates how to establish interactive, bidirectional communications to the EZO circuits through the Arduino USB/Serial connection.

You can find all code mentioned on this page, including a special Arduino YÃºn version of each sketch on [GitHub](https://github.com/whitebox-labs/tentacle-examples/tree/master/arduino/interactive).

?> With the Tentacle Mini, all your EZO Circuits must be in `I2C` mode.
