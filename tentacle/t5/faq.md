## Did you read the datasheets of your EZO Circuits?
Atlas Scientific has done an awesome job in documenting their products in beautiful datasheets.

Please download and read the datasheets of your EZO devices:

## Can the Whitebox T5 be stacked?
Yes, we designed the T5 specifically for stacking. You can stack other HATs or pHats on top of the Whitebox T5 - even those that normally don't support stacking. The Whitebox T5 has a stackable header, just like your Pi. The Whitebox T5 only uses the `I2C` and power pins, so itâ€™s very unlikely to interfere with other HATs.

You can also stack two Whitebox T5 to the same Raspberry Pi. Make sure you select [a suitable power supply](power.md#select-a-suitable-power-supply).

## My Circutit cant' be detected
Is your EZO circuit in I2C mode? It should have a blue light. If it has a green light, flashing to Cyan every second, your EZO circuit is still in UART mode. You have to switch it to I2C before it can be detected with the Whitebox T5. * [How to switch EZO Circuits to I2C](protocols.md)
