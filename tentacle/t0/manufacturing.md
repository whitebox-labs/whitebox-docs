## High Impedance Shorts
Flux residue on the PCB can create high impedance shorts, making accurate readings impossible. Signs of a high impedance short are locked values to a certain value, slowly drifting values even in calibration solution and others.

Flux residue should be removed - especially if you can measure a short with the technique described below. Remove the flux with a flux remover chemical matching the solder you use. Alternatively soak the board 20mins in alcohol or wash in an ultrasonic cleaner.


## Testing
The most important test after assembly is to find high impedance shorts. A simple way to find such shorts is by using a 12V battery (or any other 12V power source). Apply the voltage across the 2 signals you want to test and inline a Voltmeter in the mV setting.

* isolate the device under test on a silicone mat or any other non-conductive surface. The test setup must be isolated from your antistatic mat.  
If your Voltmeter can detect a voltage at all, there is a high impedance short. Remove fingerprints, dust, solder flux residue from the respective pad and pins.

## Re-usable Component Tray
We provide a set of wooden, re-usable trays to be used in pick & place machines to OEM customers.

The tray pictured below is for 54 T0s, measures 135mm x 224mm. We can adapt the size of the tray to your machine and production workflow.
