The Tentacle T3 connects to these Raspberry Pi pins

| Physical Pin | BCM pin | Name       | on the Tentacle T3             |
|-------------:|:---------|:----------|:-------------------------------|
| 1            | 3V3     | 3.3V Power | Power the I2C signal isolators |
| 2            | 5V      | 5V Power   | Power the DC isolators         |
| 9            | GND     | GND        | GND                            |
| 3            | BCM 2   | SDA        | I2C SDA                        |
| 5            | BCM 3   | SCL        | I2C SCL                        |

The Tentacle T3 does not "occupy" any pin exclusively. The T3 is mostly transparent to other HATs - they can even be stacked on top and will work as usual.
_The Tentacle T3 adds pullup resitors to the Raspberry Pi I2C lines (see [I2C Pullups](#i2c-pullups))_

## Channel 1 + 2

* Isolation: **Yes**, full power and data isolation
* Footprint: EZO Circuit
* Protocol: `I2C` only
* Probe Connector: BNC
* Best suited for:
 * `EZO pH`
 * `EZO ORP`
 * `EZO EC`
 * `EZO DO`
 * `EZO RTD` (no isolation needed)
* Voltages on the **non-isolated** (Raspberry Pi) side:
 * Vcc: `5V `
 * I2C: `3.3V `
* Voltages on the **isolated** (EZO) side:
 * Vcc: `5V`
 * I2C: `5V`

## Channel 3
* Isolation: **No**
* Footprint: EZO Circuit
* Protocol: `I2C` only
* Probe Connector: BNC
* Best suited for:
 * `EZO RTD`
* VCC: `3.3V`
* I2C: `3.3V`

## Channel 4 + 5
* Isolation: **No**
* Footprint: pin-header connector (e.g. to connect a Molex connector)
* Protocol: `I2C` only
* Probe Connector: BNC
* Best suited for:
 * 5pin EZO-class devices like the EZO-PMP, EZO-CO2 or EZO-PRS
 * 3rd-party I2C devices like the I2C Soil Moisture Sensor
* VCC: `3.3V`
* I2C: `3.3V`

### Pinout Channel 4 + 5
![Tentacle T3](/_media/channels4-5.png)
* `3V3`: 3.3V
* `GND`: GND
* `SDA`: I2C SDA
* `SCL`: I2C SCL
* `INT` (2x) â€“ both INT pins are internally connected. Some devices from Atlas Scientific provide additional functionality (Interrupts, programming, etc) to this pin. The second INT pin lets you connect a jumper wire to a GPIO pin of the Raspberry at your liking.

?> **Tip with EZO-PMP**: You can use the INT pin to know whether the pump is currently running or not. Connect the INT pin to a Raspberry GPIO and read the pin state: if it's HIGH, the pump is running, if it's LOW, the pump is off.

## I2C pullups
The Tentacle T3 for Raspberry Pi adds **4.7k** I2C pullup resistors to the `SCL` and `SDA` lines. The resistors are located above channel 3 and can be de-soldered in case you handle I2C pullups somewhere else in your system.
